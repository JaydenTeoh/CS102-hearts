![Hearts banner](./images/hearts_banner.jpeg)

Our Java project revolves around bringing the beloved card game "Hearts" to life digitally. In Hearts, players strive to avoid collecting specific cards like hearts and the queen of spades while maneuvering to offload them onto opponents. This game offers a mix of strategy, anticipation, and luck, making it a timeless favorite among players. By embarking on this project, we aim to delve into the intricacies of game logic and user interface design, all in an effort to recreate the joy and challenge of playing Hearts in a virtual environment.
